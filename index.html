    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective date: <strong>October 5, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Luxkore</strong> (the “App”), provided by <strong>Luxkore</strong> (“we”, “us” or “our”). This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices. This policy applies to the App and any related services.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> such as name, email address, or phone number, only if you voluntarily provide them (for example, when contacting support or creating an account).</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> anonymous analytics data about how the App is used (screens visited, crashes, performance metrics).</li>
      <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> device model, OS version, and app version to help diagnose issues and improve the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the App.</li>
      <li>Respond to your support requests and communicate about the App.</li>
      <li>Analyze usage patterns to enhance features and performance.</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Analytics & Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may use third-party analytics and crash-reporting services. These services collect usage data and device data. We do not control those services’ data practices — please check their privacy policies for details.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent your personal data. We may share information with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Service providers who perform services on our behalf (hosting, analytics, crash reporting).</li>
      <li>When required by law, or to protect our legal rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary to provide the App and fulfill the purposes described here, or as required by law.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>7. Children</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such data, please contact us and we will take steps to delete it.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You may request access to, correction or deletion of your personal data. To exercise these rights, contact us at the address below.</p>

    <h2>9. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>If you are located outside the country where our servers or providers operate, your data may be transferred internationally. We will take steps required by law to protect your data in such transfers.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the revised policy here with a new effective date.</p>
